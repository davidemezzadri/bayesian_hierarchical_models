# bayesian_hierarchical_models
Implementation of Gibbs sampling to estimate the posterior distribution of the parameters of two different Bayesian hierarchical models (in the context of educational setting).
- gibbs_without7.ipynb ---> model without covariates
- gibbs_with7.ipynb ---> model with covariates
In addition, there are basic diagnostics of the convergence of the algorithms: trace plots and auto-correlation functions.
